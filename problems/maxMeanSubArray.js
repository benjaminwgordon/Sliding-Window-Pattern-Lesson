/* Given an array of integers arr and a positive integer k, find the series of elements of arr with length k with the largest mean */

// first, just try to get an implementation that works
const maxMeanSubArraySlow = (arr,k) => {

// now, lets think about how we can do this faster
const maxMeanSubArray = function(arr,k){

// when you are ready, uncomment this function call and run this file with Node to see the difference!
