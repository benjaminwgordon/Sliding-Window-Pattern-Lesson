/* Given an array of integers arr and a positive integer k, find the series of elements of arr with length k with the largest sum */


// first, just try to get an implementation that works
const maxSubArraySlow = function(arr, k) {

}

// now, lets think about how we can do this faster
const maxSubArray = function(arr,k) {

}

// when you are ready, uncomment this function call and run this file with Node to see the difference!

//require('../timers').timeMaxSubArray(maxSubArraySlow, maxSubArray);
